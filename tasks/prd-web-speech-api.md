# Web Speech API Integration PRD

## 1. Introduction/Overview
Integrate the Web Speech API to enable both speech recognition (voice-to-text) and speech synthesis (text-to-voice) in the conversational AI app. This will allow users to interact with the AI agent using their voice, receive spoken responses, and control the app via voice commands. The goal is to make the chat experience more natural and accessible for general users.

## 2. Goals
- Allow users to dictate messages or commands to the AI agent.
- Enable the AI agent to read its responses aloud to users.
- Support basic voice control for the app.
- Ensure the feature matches the existing chat UI and works across all major browsers.

## 3. User Stories
- As a general user, I want to dictate messages to the AI agent so I don’t have to type.
- As a general user, I want the AI agent to read its responses aloud so I can listen instead of reading.
- As a general user, I want to control the app using voice commands for a hands-free experience.
- As a general user, if the chatbot isn’t toggled for messaging, I want a simple popup to display the transcript of what the chatbot says.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to start and stop voice recognition (speech-to-text) via a UI control.
2. The system must provide visual feedback (e.g., mic icon, real-time transcript) during voice recognition.
3. The system must use speech synthesis to read chatbot responses aloud.
4. If the chatbot is not toggled for messaging, a popup must display the transcript of the chatbot’s spoken messages.
5. The UI for speech features must match the existing chat UI style.
6. The system must not save audio files or recordings.
7. The feature must work in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No saving or downloading of audio files or voice recordings.
- No advanced voice command customization or training.
- No support for languages not supported by the Web Speech API.

## 6. Design Considerations
- All speech-related UI elements (mic icon, transcript popup) should visually match the current chat interface.
- The popup transcript should be simple, unobtrusive, and auto-dismiss or be dismissible by the user.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Must use the browser’s native Web Speech API for both recognition and synthesis.
- Must gracefully handle browsers that do not support the Web Speech API (fallback to text-only).
- Integrate with the existing chat component for seamless UX.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Feature works in all major browsers.
- Users can successfully dictate messages and hear responses.
- Visual feedback and popups function as described.
- No audio files are saved.
- No critical errors or crashes in production.

## 9. Open Questions
- Should there be a way to disable speech features for users who don’t want them?
- Should the transcript popup have any customization (e.g., duration, size)?
- Any accessibility requirements for users with disabilities?
