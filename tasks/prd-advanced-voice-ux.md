# Advanced Voice UX PRD

## 1. Introduction/Overview
Upgrade the chat agent’s voice experience with advanced features: wake word detection, continuous listening, and contextual voice feedback. The goal is to make voice interaction feel natural, hands-free, and responsive, similar to modern voice assistants.

## 2. Goals
- Allow users to activate voice recognition with a wake word (e.g., “Hey Agent!”).
- Support continuous listening mode for hands-free, multi-command sessions.
- Provide clear contextual feedback (visual and/or audio) for listening state, command recognition, and errors.
- Make these features configurable in settings.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to say “Hey Agent!” to start talking, so I don’t have to click the mic.
- As a user, I want the agent to keep listening for more commands after I finish speaking, so I can interact hands-free.
- As a user, I want to see and hear feedback when the agent is listening, has heard me, or didn’t understand, so I know what’s happening.
- As a user, I want to turn wake word and continuous listening on/off in settings.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must detect a configurable wake word (“Hey Agent!” by default) and activate voice recognition.
2. The system must support continuous listening mode, keeping the mic open for multiple commands until stopped.
3. The system must provide visual feedback (e.g., overlay, icon, animation) when listening is active.
4. The system must provide audio feedback (e.g., chime, spoken prompt) for listening start/stop, command heard, and errors.
5. The system must allow users to enable/disable wake word and continuous listening in settings.
6. The system must handle “stop listening” and “cancel” voice commands.
7. The system must gracefully handle browser/device limitations (fallback to manual mic control if needed).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No cloud-based wake word detection (must be local/in-browser for privacy).
- No support for custom user-defined wake words (only pre-set options).
- No advanced voice training or adaptation.

## 6. Design Considerations
- Visual feedback should be clear but not intrusive (e.g., animated border, overlay, or icon).
- Audio feedback should be short and pleasant (e.g., soft chime, brief spoken phrase).
- Settings UI should allow toggling wake word and continuous listening, with tooltips/help.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Use a lightweight, in-browser wake word detection library (Porcupine, Snowboy, or TensorFlow.js).
- Ensure performance is acceptable on desktop and mobile.
- Integrate with existing speech recognition and chat UI.
- Fallback to manual mic button if wake word/continuous mode is not supported.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Wake word detection works with >90% accuracy in normal conditions.
- Continuous listening mode works without major bugs or crashes.
- Users receive clear feedback for all voice states.
- No significant performance or battery issues.

## 9. Open Questions
- Which wake word(s) should be supported? (“Hey Agent!” only, or more?)
- Should there be a timeout for continuous listening? (e.g., auto-stop after X seconds of silence)
- Should audio feedback be customizable or user-selectable?
