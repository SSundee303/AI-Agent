# AI Agent with App-Specific Context

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This feature introduces an AI chat agent that answers user questions strictly about the app’s domain (e.g., real estate listings), using only in-app data. The goal is to provide focused, relevant, and accurate responses to users, avoiding off-topic or general knowledge answers.

## 2. Goals
- Ensure the AI only answers questions about the app’s content (e.g., property listings).
- Guide users through the app and help them find/filter listings.
- Clarify when a question is outside the app’s domain.

## 3. User Stories
- As a home buyer, I want to ask about properties so the AI can tell me about them based only on the app’s content.
- As a general user, I want to search/filter listings using natural language.
- As a user, I want the AI to guide me through the app’s features and navigation.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The AI must answer questions using only data available in the app (e.g., mockProperties).
2. The AI must clarify when a question is outside the app’s domain (e.g., "I can only answer questions about properties in this app.").
3. The AI must support natural language queries for searching/filtering listings.
4. The AI must provide guidance on app features and navigation.
5. The AI must not provide general knowledge or off-topic answers.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- The AI will not answer questions unrelated to the app’s content (e.g., weather, history, etc.).
- The AI will not access or use external data sources.
- The AI will not perform actions outside the app (e.g., send emails, make bookings).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- None specified yet. (UI/UX requirements may be added later.)

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- The AI should use the `mockProperties` data source for now.
- Prompt engineering should be used to ensure the AI’s context is limited to the app’s domain.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The AI answers 95%+ of in-domain questions accurately.
- The AI clarifies or rejects 100% of out-of-domain questions.
- User satisfaction with AI responses (to be measured via feedback or survey).

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any edge cases or error conditions to consider?
- Should the AI’s domain be expanded in the future (e.g., to include user preferences or other data)?
- Should there be a UI indicator that the AI is app-specific?
